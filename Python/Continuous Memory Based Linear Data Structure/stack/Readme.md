## Continuous Memory Based Linear data structure
- Stack is a non-primitive data structure
- It is linear data structure designed only with linear access instead of random access with the data stored in continuouos memory locations.
- 3 notable operations over stack: push, pop, top

### Applications of stack
1. Micro controllers and working of computers
2. Expression conversion -> infix to postfix
3. handling recursion -> last called function returns the first value
4. parsing a compiler: data stream is to be maintained for undo, error recovery, and pattern check
5. Tower of Hanoi problem
6. String reversal
7. Palindrome checking
