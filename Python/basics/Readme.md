Data Structures = Concepts + Programming skills
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Different types of data structures:
1. Linear
2. Non-linear, hierarchical
3. Non-liner, non-hierarchial
================================================================================
Abstract Data Type(ADT): a type or class object which has its own behavior and properties

4 rules of recursion:
1. every recursion must have a base case
2. the recursion call must always be towards the base case. if the inc/dec of teh condition is not towards the base case, stack overflow exception occurs
3. all recursive call in a function should work. there is no point in writing a function with a recursive call that never get executed
4. no tasks should be duplicated in a recursion
